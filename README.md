# JSON Command Line Tool

A command-line tool built in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) for reformatting
(pretty-printing) JSON.
Useful when working with JSON files, e.g. if consuming or developing JSON RESTful APIs.

There are surely other (and probably better!) tools like this out there in the node.js
ecosystem.
I'm creating this one for myself; partly to meet a need but more to experiment and learn.
